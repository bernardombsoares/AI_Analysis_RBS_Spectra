# AI for characterization of thin films using RBS

## LIP Summer Internship 23'

### [Internship Report](https://www.lip.pt/files/training/papers/2023/pdf/2023-PAPER-153-6.pdf)

### Motivation
One of the methods employed for thin film characterization is Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), a potent analytical tool that lies on the detection of back-scattered ions from a sample surface, enabling researchers to investigate material composition and properties. However, analyzing RBS data can be a laborious and time-consuming process. The use of AI models can automate this process and make it useful for experimental scenarios. In this work, we show that Artificial Neural Networks are able to predict with good accuracy targetâ€™s thickness and material based on simulated RBS spectra as training data. After processing the simulation data, we proved that the model can accurately predict gold targets developed directly in the laboratory. Additionally, we displayed how to automatically generate simulated data in the SIMNRA software.
